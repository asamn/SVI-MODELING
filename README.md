Gun violence remains undoubtedly a critical health issue in the United States, with significant disparities observed in differing communities. This study investigates the relationship between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) and firearm-related death rates at the county level, employing machine learning to identify predictive patterns. 

We compare the performance of multiple regression models - Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest, and XGBoost - trained on three datasets derived from the SVI: thematic scores, demographic measurements, and an extended dataset incorporating GDP per capita and educational attainment. Feature importance analysis suggests that socioeconomic status is the most influential thematic predictor of firearm death rates, while more fine-grained demographic measurements particularly highlight associations with disproportionately higher rates in African American communities, consistent with prior research on structural inequalities. These findings, however, are subject to the ecological fallacy. 

XGBoost outperforms other models, achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE = 9.188) on death rate predictions when trained on the extended demographic dataset; a 33.6% improvement over our baseline model (RMSE = 13.838). Findings underscore the utility of the SVI dataset as a tool for understanding gun violence and emphasize the need for tar- geted interventions in socioeconomically vulnerable communities. Future research could enhance predictive power by integrating additional variables such as gun ownership rates and mental health statistics.
